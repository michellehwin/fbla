            <h1>Travel Info</h1>
            <h2>Arriving at the Airport</h2>
            <p>
                Upon arrival at the airport, have your passports, IDs, and your ticket ready for the
                check-in desk to allow them to assist you at a much faster pace. You will be able to get
                on your flight with as little trouble as possible. Your checked baggage
                that you will not be taking onto the flight will also be handled. If your baggage exceeds the 50 pound weight limit,
                an overweight baggage fee will be charged. For baggage between 51-60 pounds, a fee of $50 will
                be charged. For baggage between 61-70 pounds, a fee of $100 will be charged. For baggage over 70 pounds,
                a fee of $200 will be charged.
            </p>
            <h2>Flying with Pets</h2>
            <p>
              Transporting service animals are free, but pets do include a $100 fee. We refuse to allow pets that
              are too big (over 15 pounds), pets other than cats or dogs, and certain breed of dogs to fly in-cabin.
              If there are any questions, please contact us.
            </p>
            <h2>Air Entertainment</h2>
            <p>
                Tonal Airlines provides as many entertainment services as possible for our passengers to enjoy.
                All of the seats on the plane includes an ipad-like technology that allows you to watch movies or TV shows,
                play games, or listen to music. We update our systems biweekly to keep all of our technology up-to-date
            </p>
            <h2>Flight Schedules and Delay</h2>
            <p>
              If there are any known changes to a flight’s schedule, Tonal Airlines will email a message to you directly.
              Passengers are also able to check the flight’s schedule on the TV screens located around the airport and are
              also able to ask any nearby workers who are on duty.
