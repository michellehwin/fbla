<p>During the early 2000s, many families found it difficult to travel to places due to high-priced plane tickets. Two friends, Michelle Nguyen and Erica Tran, decided to come together and form a discounted airline company to aid those who deserve the much-needed vacation trips. On May 16, 2013, the duo established their first airline called Tonal Airlines at the DFW airport. Without a doubt, the company sold an exceedingly amount of tickets during their first week.  Ever since then, the airline still successfully manage to sell tickets and maintain their goal. With a bright future ahead, Michelle and Erica plan to expand their airline to throughout the nation.
